Thank you for participating in this study.  

In this study we were interested in where on the target object and buttons you were looking when clicking on them. Despite the co-occurrence of both vision and visuomotor processes, vision and motor functioning are typically studied independently, so their critical interactions are poorly understood. What is currently lacking in this area is a clear understanding of where people are looking while clicking on targets of varying complexity. Specifically, this study sought to expand current understandings of visual and visuomotor interactions by characterizing the location of eye-movements made to visually presented targets. If you have any questions later on, please feel free to contact me â€“ my contact information is listed below. Thank you again for participating, and have a great day.
